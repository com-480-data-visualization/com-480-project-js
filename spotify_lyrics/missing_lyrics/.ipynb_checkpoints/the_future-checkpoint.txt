When I see a young couple walking slowly through the trees,
I don't have to follow them to know how far they'll go,
I've been there.
If the boy is sulking and the girl is close to tears,
I know it doesn't matter, who is right or who started the fight,
I've been there.
I've been there when the music played old songs,
Young songs, good songs, bad songs, sweet songs, sad songs.
I've been there when a pretty smile made it difficult to breathe,
But so easy to fly and a pleasure to cry,
So to all of you in the throes of early love,
Where delightful confusion reigns supreme,
Let me try to help you rearrange your dream,
Let yourself live, let yourself love, let yourself go.
I've been there, and I know.
