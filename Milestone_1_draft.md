**THE DATASET :**

The dataset is composed of around 300 music of Michael Jackson and features for each of them :

- Title, Album title, Year of release, Music Type…

- Audio features (laudability, energy, bpm…)

- The lyrics

The data have been obtained using the API of Spotify and [Genius.com](http://Genius.com) .

The data-set is relatively clean but needs preprocessing as :

- Delete doublons
- Merge Spotify data with Genius data
- Select interesting features
- Use NLP techniques to extract features from the lyrics

**PROBLEMATIC :**

How does the Michael Jackson song’s lyrics evolved along his different albums from the Jackson Five to his death ? What are the main topics ? How large is Michael Jackson vocabulary? What are the most used words in his songs?

**THE VISUALIZATION :**

The aim of this project is to show how the lyrics are related different features to one biggest star in the world. To construct a story on an all-known artist. Therefore, everybody will be curious about this data-visualization.

**Exploratory Data Analysis Pre-processing :**

Nobody have done such a data analysis on Michael Jackson. However, a lot of work have been done in lyrics analysis.

This is why we think that our project focused on one artist is such a motivation because it is really original and tries to show the evolution of a specific artist. A similar idea already buzzed on [reddit.com](http://reddit.com). Indeed, a designer called Silven created a mock-up of what would be a lyrics based data-visualisation on Eminem but never gave birth to it.

  

Our first inspiration is therefore the mock-up from Silven (link). Another strong inspiration is The Pudding website where a many different music data-visualization have been created ([https://pudding.cool/archives/](https://pudding.cool/archives/) using Music filter).
