Whenever Skies Look Gray To Me,
And Trouble Begins To Brew . . .
Whenever The Winter Winds Become Too Strong,
I Concentrate On You!
When Fortune Cries Nay Nay To Me,
And People Declare You're Through,
Whenever The Blues Become My Only Song,
I Concentrate On You!
On Your Smile, So Sweet, So Tender,
When At First My Kiss You Declined . . .
On The Light In Your Eyes, When You Surrender,
And Once Again Our Arms Intertwine . . .
And So When Wise Men Say To Me,
That Loves' Young Dream Never Comes True,
To Prove That Even Wise Men Can Be Wrong,
I Concentrate On You!
I Concentrate, I Concentrate,
On You
