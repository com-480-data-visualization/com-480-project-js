Step right up and step inside
You ain't seen nothing yet
Life's a rollercoaster ride
One ticket's all you get
Nothing like it anywhere
It's cheap at any price
You won't believe the view up there
From hell to paradise
Honky tonk and pleasure palaces
There's so much to see
We can take a trip like Alice's
Leave it all to me
Satin sheets and sailing ships
Never touch the shore
Painted lights and painted lips
That always ask for more
Taste it, try it, don't deny it
You'll be glad you came
Once you told me of your diet
You won't be the same
Step right up and step inside
You ain't seen nothing yet
Life's a rollercoaster ride
One ticket's all you get
Satin sheets and sailing ships
Never touch the shore
Painted lights and parted lips
That always ask for more
Taste it, try it, don't deny it
You'll be glad you came
Once you add me to your diet
You won't be the same
Step right up and step inside
You ain't seen nothing yet
Life's a rollercoaster ride
One ticket's all you get
Nothing like it anywhere
It's cheap at any price
You won't believe the view up there
From hell to paradise
There are honky tonks and pleasure palaces
So much to see
We can take a trip like Alice's
Leave it all to me
