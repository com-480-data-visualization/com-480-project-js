## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

10% of the final grade

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas. Please, fill the following sections about your project.

(max. 2000 characters per section)

## Dataset

- Spoitfy ...
-


Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.

Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets (Google dataset search, Kaggle, OpenSwissData, SNAP and FiveThirtyEight)

## Problematic

Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.

- Viz of M. J
- Word / music / year visualiazion of M. J work  


What am I trying to show with my visualization?
- Rap Genius 2.0

Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.
overview: story line  on data
motivation: Rap Genius 2.0 => Reddit success
target audience: peiple passionate about music / data visualization and D3.JS <3<3<3


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Pre-processing of the data set you chose:
   - Lyrics
   -
   - Merge

lyrics/.... main.py
spotify/... main.py

eda/ merge => dataset visualization! (jupyter notebook) [Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data]

Lyrics:
   - Word count // songs // album
   - Topic modelling
   - 

Related work

What **others** have already done with the data?
   => People already visualized lyrics / cite some cool websites
   => Spotify visualization

Why is your approach original?
   => Focus on single artist => permits to find new insights
   => there is no previous work on "MJ data-biography" (TODO)

What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
