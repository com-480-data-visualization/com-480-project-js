Pick up the god damn phone
Bitch where the fuck were you Tuesday?
With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio
Bitch what'd you do screw Dre?
You went there looking for me
Boo that excuse is too lame
Keep playing me you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg
You fake, lying slut you never told me you knew Dre
Que Lupe? You want to lose two legs
You try to flip this on me?
If I spent more time with you, you say
"Ok yeeah, I'm coo-coo, hey?" Well, screw you
And I'd be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, four? Dre, Drake, Lupe? Oh touche
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one True Blue Ace
But you ain't and I can see you when you make
That little boo-boo face 'cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo
You make my fucking Bluetooth ache
You feeling blue too late
Go smurf yourself you make me wanna smurfin' puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate
My life will be so much better
If you just dropped dead (dead)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead (dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better (better, better, better)
Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway trying to get some time alone and just think
Then the cops pulled me over but they let me go
'Cause I told 'em I'm only driving drunk
'Cause that bitch drove me to drink I'm back on my fuck ho's
But a whole new hatred for blondes, but bias?
I hate all bitches the same, baby come on
Excuse the pun but bitch you're such a broad statement
And I am channeling my anger through every single station it's on
'Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say he-art
'Cause you ripped it in two pa-arts
And threw it in the garbage, who do you think you are?
Bitch guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again
I la-la-la-la lesbian
Ah
I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
My life would be so much better if you just
My life will be so much better
If you just dropped dead (dead)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead (dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better (better, better, better)
'Cause you told me
You'd love me,
Forever
Bitch, that was a lie
Now I never
Wanted someone to die
So bad in my fucking, life
But fuck it there's other fish in the sea
And I'mma have a whale of a time
Being a single sailor for the night bitch on a scale
Of 1 to 10, shit I must be the holy grailer
Catch this ho I got an Oscar attached to my fucking name (great)
I might hit the club on a chica's tail, uh
Made for me say fuck it kick some shots back and hammer the nailer
These bitches tryna get atached with the failer
And latch him to the tail of my bumper
To scratch them with the back of my trailer like I'm itchin' to get hitched
Yeah I'm rich as a bitch but bitches ain't shit
I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me
That's what I call pitchin' a bicth
That's why I'm swinging at this chicks on sight
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void bitch I'm a droid,
I void cupid stupid wasn't for blowjobs you'd be unemployed
Oi oi oi, man oh man, you boy boy boys
Getting sick at these girls girls girls
Oink oink oink
You fucking pigs all you good boys doink doink doing
I got 99 problems and the bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of them I need a machine gun
I take 'em all out I hope you hear this song
And grow into a cardiac arrest
Have a heart attack and just drop dead
And I'mma throw a fucking party after this 'cause
My life will be so much better
If you just dropped dead (dead)(I hate you)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head (you baby)
And I thought wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead (dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better (better, better, better)
I'm just playing bitch, you know I love you
